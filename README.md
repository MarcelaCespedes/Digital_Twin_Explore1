# Digital Twin: exploration (v1)

In this repo we explore very basic concepts of a digital twin as discussed in [1].

First, data to represent "original entity" or system to monitor, understand and analyse will be stored in this repo and summarised.

Secondly, code to pull in data, and initialise "digital twin" model is generated.

Lastly, code to create relavent feedback between "original entity" and "digital twin" is available.
